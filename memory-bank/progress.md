# Progress

## What Works
- The basic structure of the Flask application for MAB and RMAB seems to be in place.
- API endpoints for recommendations, clicks, tenant creation, and arm creation are defined in both `multi_armed_bandit.py` and `rank_multi_armed_bandit.py`.
- Thompson Sampling logic is implemented.
- Docker configuration (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) is present.
- Initial Memory Bank files have been created.

## What's Left to Build/Modify
1.  **`main.py` functionality**: Clarify and implement the role of `main.py`, especially if it's intended to be a dispatcher based on `BANDIT_MODE` and manage app/DB initialization. (Currently out of immediate scope but a known future step).
2.  **Testing**: Implement tests to ensure the database configuration works correctly for both SQLite and PostgreSQL, and for both MAB and RMAB modes.
3.  **Documentation Updates**: Keep Memory Bank files and `.clinerules` updated as development progresses.

## Current Status
- **Overall**: Core application logic for bandits now uses environment-driven database configurations. `psycopg2-binary` is confirmed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Current Task**: Completed refactoring of database configuration in bandit modules.
- **Blockers**: None.

## Known Issues
- The `main.py` file's purpose and implementation regarding bandit mode selection and app initialization are not yet fully integrated with the bandit modules. This is the primary remaining piece for robust execution via `docker-compose` using `BANDIT_MODE`.
